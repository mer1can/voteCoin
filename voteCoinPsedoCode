#VoteCoin Project

###Forgive my pseudocode

###Feel free to edit this, on one condition: You leave your additions in commented form, along with your name (or handle) next to your additions.

###Coin Definitions Here###

#Coins should be divided into the different elections (i.e. County, Municiple, State, Federal) just like a dollar can be seen as four quarters, 10 dimes, 20 nickels, etc.


#Address Designation (Candidate accounts)
#Voters "Spend" their VoteCoin on the candidates they want to vote for. 

###Example###
#Federal (Presidential Accounts):
#Trump's Address: 0x872gj3997hdj733887
#Kamala's Address: 0x98hqoa887ddnk3092
#RFK's Address: 0x99jd93jdjx8eb399en299sn

###State Accounts:
#[ALABAMA - WYOMING]

###Local Accounts:
#[Counties of states, boards, municipalities, etc]
###Touples or dictionaries?? Will get complex based on location, but we can work that out


#Coins are premined to have the estimated number of coins as votes
#One person to one coin
#Premined coins: 150,000,000 



#Utilize existing KYC (Know Your Customer) technology to verify the authenticity of coins before dispersal
